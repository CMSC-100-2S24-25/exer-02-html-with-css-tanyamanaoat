                    Hello, my name is Tanya Marinelle G. Manaoat. I graduated from the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os with a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a deep interest in programming and software development, which led me to explore various languages and technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at the university, I was exposed to a wide range of subjects that honed my problem-solving skills and provided a strong foundation in computer science. I have since applied my knowledge to projects involving Python, C++, JavaScript, and many more, building solutions that address real-world challenges.
