### Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. Open Github repository and go to settings.
2. Click Pages and change branch to main.
3. Allow page to refresh and click on the newly published site on the top bar.

### Key Takeaways:
One really useful feature in HTML is the use of **semantic elements** like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`. These help make your code cleaner, more accessible, and better for search engines by clearly defining what each part of a webpage is for. In CSS, **Flexbox** is a game-changer for layouts because it lets elements adjust automatically to fit different screen sizes, making responsive design much simpler without needing to rely on complicated math or positioning.
